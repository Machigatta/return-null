# Chapter 1 - Prologue
Being a developer is easy these days. Becoming a better one on the other hand, requires you to be a lot more enthusiastic than others. You have to be the special one in class who is not afraid of being himself and showing what he likes. You have to think out of the box and not take your chances for granted. I could go on and on and envelope more examples how you should behave. But on the end, we are all the same... Developers... Developers who have their Ups and Downs. And let me make this clear, there are way more downs than ups. This job is not a very rewarding job. You are always the one to blame if something doesn't work. You are developer, quality ensurance and support in one person and you are doing it, because you got the passion to do it. 

But not every day is like the first day in a new company. You might be not as productive as the day before and still try to do your work. So you stick to it and do it, because it's your job. Because you got the passion, because you got the skills and because you like to develope new things. So you go home from your work and there you are... maybe with family, maybe without and you are exhausted. You sit down on your computer and there they are: Your unfinished projects and ideas. Waiting to be finished, waiting to be worked on and waiting to be started. You have ideas, innovations and projects ready to be pitched, but they are staying were they are. On a repository or your local-harddrive, doesn't matter... they are unfinished.
